# Exchanges Puzzle Game
A game of trading and combining. This distills the "item trading puzzles" you see in many adventure titles down to it's purest form.
You'll only need the main mouse button and/or a finger for your touchscreen:
  * Click / Tap
    * to focus on an item
    * to combine the focused item with another
  * Held Click / Long Press
    * to ask NPCs what they want
  * Alternatively, drag-then-drop to focus-then-combine in one action.

# Web Features
This project was an exercise in developing a modern web project with no frameworks and as many useful features as all platforms now support.
In that vein, here's the web platform features I was particularly interested in getting to use, originally based on [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14UXVubbQEP-4PO832kH4HpRE9S3NaVBGhfuQDwh2_Y8/):
 * Semantic elements
 * SVG images
 * System UI Font
 * CSS Variables
 * Scalable CSS Units instead of fixed pixels
 * Grid and Flexbox
 * Native Dialog (with polyfill)
 * JS modules
 * JS classes
 * Drag and Drop
 * Touch-Friendly: Tap vs Long Press detection
 * JS LocalStorage
 * FullScreen API
 * JS Promises
 * JS Fetch API (replaces XMLHttpRequest)
 * JS Arrow Functions

Additionally, ESLint was used to double-check the code.

# P.S.
If you attempt to open the html file instead of using a server, the levels will not load.
